NOTE: logging.properties is no longer built into our webapps.

Prior to this change, logging.properties lived in src/main/resources, and it
ended up getting deployed into WEB-INF/classes in the expanded war.  Going
forward, we want to be able to control logging properties independently of
the build and release process, i.e. to make ad-hoc troubleshooting easier.

To enable this "externalization" of logging.properties, our new <Context>
(which lives in src/main/webapp/META-INF/context.xml) declares a "virtual
classpath" that Tomcat scans prior to loading our webapp.  For example:

<Context>
  <Loader className="org.apache.catalina.loader.VirtualWebappLoader"
          virtualClasspath="${catalina.base}/virtualcp/adfonic-admin" />
</Context>

So, in order to control logging levels for this webapp, you simply need to
create that directory structure and either symlink or copy logging.properties
into that directory.  Here are some commands you can use to do that:

$ mkdir -p $TOMCAT_HOME/virtualcp/adfonic-admin
$ ln -s /path/to/etc/logging.properties $TOMCAT_HOME/virtualcp/adfonic-admin

If you don't have symlinks available (i.e. on Windows), you can simply copy
etc/logging.properties and make changes directly to that file.
