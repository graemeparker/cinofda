Just stuff for my local use normally.

checking-in this folder only to provide the ability to load the test data provided in misc

Scripts are elementary and some needs to be updated before running. 
Any running has to be with the PWD same as the residing dir currently.

set ADF_DB_ROOT to db root

Just the following 3 commands should be sufficient - ignore the others
./upd && ./dropdbs && ./load-test-data
