1. Generating java source from the OpenX protobuf specification:

cat OpenX.proto.header ssrtb.proto_v7_0.txt > OpenX.proto
protoc --java_out=../../java OpenX.proto

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Generating OpenX-to-Adfonic category mappings:

2a. Take the Excel spreadsheet from the product team and save the sheet
that provides OpenX to IAB/ADF category mappings as a CSV file here as:

src/main/resources/OpenX/openx-category-to-iabid.csv

2b. Run the generate-openx-category-mappings script from this directory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Generating Adfonic-to-OpenX category and content mappings:

3a. Take the Excel spreadsheet from the product team and save the sheet
that provides IAB/ADF to OpenX category mappings, make sure you correct
it so that the content mappings are working (the version I got wasn't
working so I had to fix the VLOOKUP).  Save that as a CSV file here as:

src/main/resources/OpenX/adfonic-iabid-to-openx-category.csv

3b. Run the generate-adfonic-category-mappings script from this directory.
